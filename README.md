# PlotTV - API

## Project Summary

PlotTv - API implements the back-end of PlotTv, a full stack project for developing an app that plots the evolution of TV Series' IMDB ratings over time.

The application's client side is available [here](https://github.com/dportela24/budget-board-client), implemented using React.

**Note:** Both server and client side of this project are still under development.

## Built with

This project was developed using Spring Boot + Maven. Data about new series is fetched using the project's [IMDBScraper](https://github.com/dportela24/IMDBScraper-java).
The database is managed through MySql using the Hibernate framework.

## Usage

For now, the server exposes a single endpoint for `GET` requests, `/tvseries`, to request data concerning a given TV Series.
This endpoint supports requests both for the TV Series name as for its IMDB ID, through a `q` query parameter.

As an example, a request for data about the TV Series Game Of Thrones can be performed as follows:

`/tvseries?q=Game+Of+Thrones` or `/tvseries?q=tt0944947`

A sucessfull response from this endpoint returns a JSON following the structure:

```json
